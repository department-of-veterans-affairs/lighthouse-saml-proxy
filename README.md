# VA.gov SAML Proxy

This app provides a SAML SP and a SAML IdP that allows it to proxy SAML requests from Okta, which VA.gov will use as an OpenID Connect provider, and ID.me which VA.gov currently uses a authentication service. 

## Installation

Requires Docker and/or Node.js > 8.

### Config File

You'll need to create a configuration JSON file with at the least the following minimum fields:

dev-config.json

```json
{
  "idpAcsUrl": "",
  "idpIssuer": "",
  "idpAudience": "",
  "idpBaseUrl": "",
  "spIdpMetaUrl": "https://api.idmelabs.com/saml/metadata/provider",
  "spNameIDFormat": "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent",
  "spAudience": "",
  "spIdpIssuer": "api.idmelabs.com",
  "spAuthnContextClassRef": "",
  "spAcsUrls": "/samlproxy/sp/saml/sso"
}
```

`idpAcsUrl`, `idpIssuer`, `idpAudience`, and `idBaseUrl` are all configuration provided from id.me.

### Commands

Docker: 
```bash
docker build -t saml-idp .
docker run -p 7000:7000 saml-idp --config dev-config.json
```

Node:
```bash
npm install
npm run-script start-dev
```

### Generating IdP Signing Certificate

**This key will not work with ID.me without further configuration.**

You must generate a self-signed certificate for the IdP.

> The private key should be unique to your test IdP and not shared!

You can generate a keypair using the following command (requires openssl in your path):

``` shell
openssl req -x509 -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -subj '/C=US/ST=California/L=San Francisco/O=JankyCo/CN=Test Identity Provider' -keyout idp-private-key.pem -out idp-public-cert.pem -days 7300
```

You will also need to generated a self-signed certificate of the SP functions

``` shell
openssl req -x509 -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -subj '/C=US/ST=California/L=San Francisco/O=JankyCo/CN=Test Identity Provider' -keyout sp-key.pem -out sp-cert.pem -days 7300
```

You can also grab the development certificates from [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-contrib/blob/master/Developer%20Process/SAML%20Proxy/Certificates.md).

## SAML Flow

The proxy fills both roles typically seen in a SAML interaction:
- It acts as an Identity Provider (IDP) relative to Okta. It receives a SAML request from Okta, and returns a SAML response.
- It acts as a Service Provider (SP) relative to ID.me. It sends a SAML request to ID.me, and receives a SAML response. 

These two interactions are interleaved, - the request received from Okta is re-signed and passed along to ID.me. Then the respone from ID.me is validated, transformed, re-signed, and passed along to Okta. 

Flow of the SAML login process:

This is a hybrid JavaScript/Typescript application. Our goal is eventually have it be completely written in Typescript, therefor all new features should be written in TypeScript and have accompanying test written using Jest.
